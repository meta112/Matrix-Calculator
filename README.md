# Matrix-Calculator
 
Still WIP. Currently able to add matrices given inputs in cell mode.

To do:

- Be able to output results as fractions or decimals for better precision
- Add more operations
- Add textbox input
- Create warnings for invalid inputs
- Show step-by-step solutions
- Create a method to view past calculations and reuse matrices
